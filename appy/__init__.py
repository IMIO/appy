class Config:
    '''Root of all configuration options for your app'''

    # These options are those managed by the app developer: they are not meant
    # to be edited during the app lifetime by end users. For such "end-user"
    # configuration options, you must extend the appy.model.tool.Tool class,
    # designed for that purpose. In short, this Config file represents the "RAM"
    # configuration, while the unique appy.model.tool.Tool instance within every
    # app contains its "DB" configuration.

    # In your app/__init__.py, create a class named "Config" that inherits from
    # this one and will override some of the atttibutes defined here, ie:

    # import appy
    # class Config(appy.Config):
    #     someAttribute = "someValue"

    # If "someAttribute" is not a standard Appy attribute, this is a way to add
    # your own configuration attributes.

    # If you want to modify existing attributes, like model configuration or
    # user interface configuration (that, if you have used appy/bin/make to
    # generate your app, are already instantiated in attributes "model" and
    # "ui"), after the attribute definition, modify it like this:

    # class Config(appy.Config):
    #     ...
    #     ui.languages = ('en', 'fr')
    #     model.rootClasses = ['MyClass']

    # of the Appy HTTP server.
